# We can't start riak-cs it in CMD because at this moment as we don't
# yet know riak's addresses -- those are to be allocated by docker
# stack and need to be discovered after that.  All we can do is
# prepare the container, for a script run after docker stack deploy to
# do orchestration aid in the form of sed'ding the right values into
# riak-cs.conf.  It is unfortunate we have to plug a sleep loop for
# the process being monitored by docker, but that's one practical
# solution I have in mind now.
